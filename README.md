# Tiny Projects

The intention of this repository is for learning and practicing ([in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public))
implementing concepts (i.e. graphql federation), software patterns, a combination of old/new technologies (i.e. bun, turborepo), etc,
in a small yet (semi) realistic project setting.

Still very early days!
